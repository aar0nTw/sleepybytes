At some point, I started enjoying the act of buying books to give to others.

In the fast-paced world of information technology, books are often considered outdated sources of knowledge. With the internet providing real-time updates, it's easy to stay connected to the latest trends. My browser used to be set to YC Hacker News by default, and I’d regularly browse through Reddit, Twitter, and GitHub, feeling like I might miss out on the next big thing in the tech world.

And yet, I still love reading books.

A book is fundamentally different from the fragmented and fleeting pieces of information found online. It embodies the culmination of an author’s deep expertise in a given field. It's the distillation of time, experience, and effort. Even if it’s not a life’s work, it’s often the result of years of accumulated insights and lessons.

Books, with their well-organized chapters and deliberate structure, allow readers to absorb what might be years of the author's knowledge in the span of just a few hours or days. This exchange of ideas feels like a thoughtful conversation with the author, where their thoughts, experiences, and reflections are passed down to you. Through this process, the information is internalized and transformed into your own knowledge.

In a sense, a book is more than just a source of information—it's a vessel that transcends time and space, connecting minds across dimensions.
